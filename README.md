## 🚀 THE TURNKEY SOLUTION
This is not a demo. This is **Production-Ready, Fully Functional Logic**. No mocks. No stubs. No placeholders.

### 🌟 PERFORMANCE & INTELLIGENCE
The MrIridescent ATS Matcher has been evolved into a high-precision recruitment weapon:
- **Semantic Vector Matching**: Utilizing spaCy `en_core_web_md` for conceptual alignment between JDs and Resumes.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Powered by **CrewAI**, featuring specialized agents for Analysis, Scoring, and Verification.
- **Forensic Experience Validation**: Strict logic ensures that only *relevant* experience in matching roles and technologies is scored.
- **Hallucination Protection**: A dedicated **Validator Agent** cross-references all AI output against raw source data.

## 🛠️ TURNKEY SETUP (NOOB-FRIENDLY)

Setting up the system is now a single-step "Copy-Paste" process:

```bash
# Clone and Enter
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mriridescent-ats-matcher.git
cd mriridescent-ats-matcher

# Run the Turnkey Setup Wizard
python setup_wizard.py
```

*The wizard will automatically install dependencies, download NLP models, configure your `.env` file, and initialize the database.*
